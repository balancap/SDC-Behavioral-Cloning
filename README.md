# Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Behavioral Cloning

Third project of the Udacity Nanodegree, and until now, the most challenging and fun one! What is this about? Basically, reimplement a simple version of the recent [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf) from Nvidia research team who described a neural network being able to perform end-to-end learning on self-driving cars. 

For that purpose, the Udacity team designed a simple simulator which let us acquire data (i.e. cameras, steering angle, speed and gas) and then test our solution of a self-driving neural network.

## Project Overview

Here are the main files constituting the project:
* `model.py`: Contains the model description and the basic code necessary for training;
* `drive.py`: Mainly Udacity code. Used to send the steering and gas commands to the simulator in self-driving mode. Just added some simple pre-processing to input image (normalization and cropping).
* `convert_img_to_data.py`: (Long) source in charge of pre-processing and augmenting the data generated by the simulator. It provides as output training data in numpy format (.npz files).
* `image_processing.py`: Custom improvements over the Keras implementation of the class `ImageDataGenerator`. I have added data flipping (image + steering angle) and additional color augmentation (random modification of constrast, brightness and saturation of input images).
